DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 7, '5/8', 'V65/IV') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c14n04_fuguete --
	The label 'V65/IV' in m. 7, onset 5/8 (MC 7, onset 5/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('#3', '5', '7', '1') [('F#', 'A', 'C', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
