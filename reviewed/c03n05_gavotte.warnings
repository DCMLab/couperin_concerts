Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review (v1.2.9)
=====================================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 7, '1/2', 'iv/IV') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c03n05_gavotte
	The label 'iv/IV' in m. 6, onset 1/2 (MC 7, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('b7', 'b2', '4') [('Bb', 'Db', 'F')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 7, '3/4', 'V2') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c03n05_gavotte

	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
