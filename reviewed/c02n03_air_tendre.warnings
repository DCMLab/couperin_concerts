DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 35, '1/4', 'vi%7') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c02n03_air_tendre
	The label 'vi%7' in m. 35, onset 1/4 (MC 35, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('7', 'b2', 'b4', '6') [('C', 'Eb', 'Gb', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
