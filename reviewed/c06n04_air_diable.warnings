DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 5, '1/4', 'V') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c06n04_air_diable
	The label 'V' in m. 4, onset 1/4 (MC 5, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Bb.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('4', '6', '1') [('Eb', 'G', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
