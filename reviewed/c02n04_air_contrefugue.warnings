DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 56, '3/8', 'V65(2)') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c02n04_air_contrefugue
	The label 'V65(2)' in m. 54, onset 3/8 (MC 56, onset 3/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('#1', '#3', '5', '7') [('D#', 'F#', 'A', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
