DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '3/4', 'viio6') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c08n02_ritournele --
	The label 'viio6' in m. 11, onset 3/4 (MC 11, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of g.iv, it expresses the scale degrees ('b2', 'b4', '7') [('Db', 'Fb', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
