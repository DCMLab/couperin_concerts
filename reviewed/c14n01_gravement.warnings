DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 14, '7/8', 'V7') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c14n01_gravement
	The label 'V7' in m. 14, onset 7/8 (MC 14, onset 7/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('#6', '#1', '#3', '5') [('B', 'D#', 'F#', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
