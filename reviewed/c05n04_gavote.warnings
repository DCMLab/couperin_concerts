Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review (v1.2.7)
=====================================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 10, '3/4', 'V') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c05n04_gavote
	The label 'V' in m. 9, onset 3/4 (MC 10, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of f.v, it expresses the scale degrees ('5', '#7', '2') [('G', 'B', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
