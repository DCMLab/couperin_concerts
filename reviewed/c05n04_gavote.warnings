Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review (v1.2.9)
=====================================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 21, '3/4', 'V43/iv') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c05n04_gavote
	The label 'V43/iv' in m. 19, onset 3/4 (MC 21, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of f.VII, it expresses the scale degrees ('b7', 'b2', 'b3', '5') [('Db', 'Fb', 'Gb', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
