Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 24, '7/8', 'V7') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.parnasse_05 --
	The label 'V7' in m. 23, onset 7/8 (MC 24, onset 7/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('5', '7', '2', '4') [('A', 'C#', 'E', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
