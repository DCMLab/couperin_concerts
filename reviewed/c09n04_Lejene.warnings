DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 36, '0', 'V.V2/V') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c09n04_Lejene
	The label 'V.V2/V' in m. 34, onset 0 (MC 36, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of E.V, it expresses the scale degrees ('7', '#1', '#3', '#5') [('A#', 'B#', 'D##', 'F##')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
