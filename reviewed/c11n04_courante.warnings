DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 4, '5/4', 'V65/III') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c11n04_courante
	The label 'V65/III' in m. 3, onset 5/4 (MC 4, onset 5/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('2', '4', '6', '7') [('D', 'F', 'Ab', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
