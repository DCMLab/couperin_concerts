DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 4, '0', 'V') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c07n05_gavote
	The label 'V' in m. 3, onset 0 (MC 4, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of g.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('2', '#4', '#6') [('A', 'C#', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
