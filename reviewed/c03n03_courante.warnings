Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 2, '3/4', 'VI2') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c03n03_courante --
	The label 'VI2' in m. 1, onset 3/4 (MC 2, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('b5', '6', '1', '3') [('Eb', 'F', 'A', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
