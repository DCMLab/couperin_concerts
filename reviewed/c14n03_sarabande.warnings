Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '1/2', 'V7') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c14n03_sarabande --
	The label 'V7' in m. 11, onset 1/2 (MC 11, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('5', '7', '2', '4') [('C', 'E', 'G', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

	The label 'vi' in m. 15, onset 0 (MC 15, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).

	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
