DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '1/2', 'V7') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c14n03_sarabande
	The label 'V7' in m. 11, onset 1/2 (MC 11, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('1', '3', '5', 'b7') [('F', 'A', 'C', 'Eb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
