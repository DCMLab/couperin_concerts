DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 31, '1/2', 'I.III6') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c02n01_prelude
	The label 'I.III6' in m. 29, onset 1/2 (MC 31, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('#6', '#1', '#4') [('B#', 'D#', 'G#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
