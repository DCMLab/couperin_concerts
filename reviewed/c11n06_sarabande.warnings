DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 27, '1/2', 'V') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c11n06_sarabande
	The label 'V' in m. 27, onset 1/2 (MC 27, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('b7', '2', '4') [('Db', 'F', 'Ab')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
