DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 6, '11/16', 'IVM7') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c01n02_allemande --
	The label 'IVM7' in m. 5, onset 11/16 (MC 6, onset 11/16) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.V, it expresses the scale degrees ('4', '6', '1', '3') [('G', 'B', 'D', 'F#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
