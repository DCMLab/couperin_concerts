DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 5, '1/8', 'V65/iv') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c03n08_chaconne_legere --
	The label 'V65/iv' in m. 4, onset 1/8 (MC 5, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('3', '5', 'b7', '1') [('E', 'G', 'Bb', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.7142857142857143 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
