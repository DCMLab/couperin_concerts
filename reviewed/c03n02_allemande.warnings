=====================================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 7, '0', 'V6') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c03n02_allemande
	The label 'V6' in m. 6, onset 0 (MC 7, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of A.V, it expresses the scale degrees ('#2', '#4', '7') [('F##', 'A#', 'D#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
