Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review (v1.2.9)
=====================================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '3/4', 'V7/iv') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c01n04_gavotte
	The label 'V7/iv' in m. 8, onset 3/4 (MC 11, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of g.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('b7', '2', '4', 'b6') [('Ab', 'C', 'Eb', 'Gb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
