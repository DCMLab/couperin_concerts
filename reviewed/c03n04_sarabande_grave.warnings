DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 8, '11/16', 'i') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c03n04_sarabande_grave
	The label 'i' in m. 8, onset 11/16 (MC 8, onset 11/16) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.III, it expresses the scale degrees ('1', 'b3', '5') [('C', 'Eb', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
