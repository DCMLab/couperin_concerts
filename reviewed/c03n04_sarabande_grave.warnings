DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 23, '5/8', '#viio65/iv') ms3.Parse.couperin_concerts.c03n04_sarabande_grave
	The label '#viio65/iv' in m. 23, onset 5/8 (MC 23, onset 5/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.iv, it expresses the scale degrees ('#6', '1', '3', '#4') [('B', 'D', 'F', 'G#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
